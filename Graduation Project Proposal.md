# General IOT interface controller 

###  Main IDEA 


Design a controller for IOT by separating the pin unit from the computing unit.


### Advantages: 

 1. **Flexibility:** This design allows you to connect different pin units to the same computing unit, depending on your specific needs. This can be particularly useful for applications that require a variety of sensors and actuators. 
2. **Scalability:** You can easily scale your system by adding more pin units or upgrading the computing unit. This makes your product adaptable to growing needs. 
3. **Cost-effectiveness:** Separating the units could potentially reduce the cost of manufacturing and assembly. This can make your product more competitive in the market.
4. **Modular design:** This modularity allows for easier repair and maintenance. If one unit fails, you can replace it without having to replace the entire system.
